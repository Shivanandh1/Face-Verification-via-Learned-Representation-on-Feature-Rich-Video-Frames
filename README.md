# Face-Verification-via-Learned-Representation-on-Feature-Rich-Video-Frames
This project is based on deep learning and neural network written in MATLAB
we propose a novel face verification algorithm, which starts with selecting feature-rich frames from a video sequence using discrete wavelet transform and entropy computation. Frame selection is followed by representation learning-based feature extraction, where three contributions are presented: 1) deep learning architecture, which is a combination of stacked denoising sparse autoencoder (SDAE) and deep Boltzmann machine (DBM); 2) formulation for joint representation in an autoencoder; and 3) updating the loss function of DBM by including sparse and low rank regularization. Finally, a multilayer neural network is used as the classifier to obtain the verification decision.
